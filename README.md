# Be smart or be a developer

This project shows logic brainteasers and how to solve them with brute force.
It's intended use is not to avoid thinking about brainteasers---they are still fun---but to have little programming exercises to improve one's skills.
In class rooms, there are way too many exercises like 'remove the n-th element from the list and randomize it'.
Although, they help students to practice programming, they are not motivated by it.
As a passionate developer, this is the key to becoming a better developer.
Fulfilling a task with a programm is like solving a puzzle.
Obviously, you enjoy a puzzle much better if you like the motive.


## Brainteaser
The following brainteasers are already implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.
This allows for better understanding each step in the process.

### Probability of picking a red ball
This brinteaser is a about estimating the---somewhat counterintuitive---probability of picking a red ball from a bowl after already having picked a red ball without returning it.
One constraint is that of the three balls in the bowl, one is red, one is blue and one is either red or blue (with a 50% probability).
This is similar to the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) where the participant has incomplete information.

### Finding the heavy ball on a scale
This brainteaser is a 'classic' brainteaser where you have a scale and three or nine balls.
One ball is heavier and you need to find it by using the scale only once (twice).
